# Password Strength Checker

## **Overview**

The **Password Strength Checker** is a Python script that evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria and provides suggestions for improvement. It checks the following aspects of a password:

- **Length**
- **Uppercase and lowercase characters**
- **Numbers**
- **Special characters**
- **Commonly used passwords**

The password strength is categorized as **"Weak"**, **"Medium"**, or **"Strong"**, and the user is provided with suggestions to improve the password based on the evaluation.

---

## **Features**

- Evaluates password length and strength.
- Suggests improvements based on:
  - Password length.
  - Inclusion of uppercase and lowercase characters.
  - Presence of numbers and special characters.

## **Future Improvements**

We plan to enhance this project with the following features:

- **Real-time feedback**: Use a GUI (e.g., with Tkinter) or a web app (with Flask or Django) for a more interactive user experience.
- **Password Leak Database Integration**: Integrate with a password leak database (e.g., Have I Been Pwned) to check if the entered password has been exposed in any data breaches.
- **Password Encryption**: Implement encryption to securely store and check passwords using hashing techniques such as bcrypt.
