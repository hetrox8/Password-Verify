Password Strength Checker
Overview

This Password Strength Checker is a simple Python script that evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria and provides suggestions for improvement. It checks the following aspects of a password:

    Length
    Uppercase and lowercase characters
    Numbers
    Special characters
    Commonly used passwords

The password strength is then categorized as "Weak", "Medium", or "Strong", and the user is provided with suggestions to improve the password based on the evaluation.

Future Improvements

We plan to enhance this project with the following features:

    Real-time feedback: Use a GUI (e.g., with Tkinter) or a web app (with Flask or Django) for a more interactive user experience.
    Password Leak Database Integration: Integrate with a password leak database (e.g., Have I Been Pwned) to check if the entered password has been exposed in any data breaches.
    Password Encryption: Implement encryption to securely store and check passwords using hashing techniques such as bcrypt.
