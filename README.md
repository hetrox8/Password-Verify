# **Password Strength Checker Documentation**

## **Overview**

The **Password Strength Checker** is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of a given password and provide suggestions for improvement. It checks the following aspects of a password:

- **Length**
- **Uppercase and lowercase characters**
- **Numbers**
- **Special characters**
- **Commonly used passwords**

The password strength is categorized as **"Weak"**, **"Medium"**, or **"Strong"**, and the user is provided with actionable suggestions to improve the password.

---

## **Features**

- **Password Evaluation**: Checks the strength of a password based on multiple criteria.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Provides specific feedback to enhance password security.
- **Common Password Check**: Verifies if the password is commonly used and vulnerable to attacks.

---

## **How It Works**

The tool evaluates a password based on the following criteria:

1. **Length**: Passwords shorter than 8 characters are considered weak.
2. **Character Diversity**: Passwords must include a mix of:
   - Uppercase letters (`A-Z`)
   - Lowercase letters (`a-z`)
   - Numbers (`0-9`)
   - Special characters (`!@#$%^&*()`)
3. **Common Passwords**: The tool checks if the password is in a list of commonly used passwords.

Based on these checks, the tool assigns a strength rating and provides suggestions for improvement.
